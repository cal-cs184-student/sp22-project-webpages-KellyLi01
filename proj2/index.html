          <p>
              de Casteljau’s algorithm is used to recursively create Bezier curves given lines. For each step, the algorithm splits
              each line into two subsections with a point on the line and creates new intermediate lines by connecting the new points drawn.
              We repeat steps until we have one final point, which will be the point our Bezier curve draws through. Our algorithm is implemented by
              looping through our control points and recursively finding the intermediate points of each line with the equation: (1 - t) * first_endpoint +
              (t) * second_endpoint with a given t (which is a decided weight that represents how close to the first point we are).

              <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
              <p>
                  The de Casteljau algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces by performing the algorithm on two different axes, u and v (and thus making Bezier curves that are parameterized by u and v, respectively).
                  To visualize, we have a plane with the u and v axes. The u curves find all the curves along the u axis (i.e. slices of a hill), then the singular v curve smooths over all the u curves to create the surface (like a 3D image of the hill slices put together).
                  Our final point is a point that lies on the v curve that was created using the interpolated u curve points. We implemented this by copying the algorithm from part 1 but altering it to work with 3D points.
                  We then ran the algorithm to completion for each u-curve to get the final interpolated points of each. Then, we ran the bezier curve algorithm again on a vector of these final points to get the v-curve.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

          <p>
              We first found two adjacent half edges coming out of the vertex and the respective neighboring vertices.
              We found the cross product using the neighboring vertices
              (and subtracted the current vertex’s position from both so that the vectors start at the origin),
              then calculated its norm. The norm of this cross product is also equal to 2 times the area of the triangle,
              so it will be used in calculating the area weights. We repeated this for all adjacent half edges of the vertex.
              Using the norms and the sum of all the norms, we calculated the area weights for each cross product.
              We then added the area weight * cross product of each triangle to get the approximate normal at the vertex.
              We then normalized the normal to get the approximate unit normal.

                  </tr>
              </table>
          </div>

          <p>
              First, we check if the <i>EdgeIter</i> inputted is a boundary.
              If it is on a boundary, we immediately return.
              Then, we store everything we will need for the edge flip (all our halfedges, vertex positions, and faces).
              Refer to the diagram above for vertex names.
          </p>

          <p>
              We start by reassigning the halfedges associated with the to-be-flipped edge.
              Halfedge b→c’s root vertex is reassigned from b to d.
              We will refer to this as halfedge 1.
              Halfedge c→b’s root vertex is reassigned from c to a.
              We will refer to this halfedge as halfedge 2.
          </p>

          <p>
              Then, we reassign the halfedge that vertex c returns when halfedge() is called to halfedge c→a.
              We also reassign the halfedge that vertex b returns when halfedge() is called to halfedge b→d.
              This prevents the flipped edge from impacting the halfedges returned at their previous vertices.
              Then, we reassign the original left face (a,b,c)’s halfedge to be the halfedge from a→b
              (this will be the halfedge corresponding to the top face).
              We also reassign the original right face (b,d,c) halfedge to be the halfedge from d→c
              (this will be the halfedge corresponding to the bottom face).
          </p>

          <p>
              After setting the faces, we reassign all the corresponding next() calls for each halfedge in the impacted faces.
              Finally, we set the faces for c→a to (a, c, d) and b→d to (a, b, d) because they switched faces as a result of the edge flip.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

          <p>
              For edge split, we used setNeighbors() since we are making 1 new vertex, 2 new faces, and 3 new edges.
              We first created the new vertex at the midpoint of the edge that we were to split.
              Then, we created the new faces, edges, and their respective halfedges. 
              Then we used setNeighbors to assign our 8 halfedges that point to or are rooted at m their respective next(), twin(), vertex, edge, and faces. 
              Finally, four of our halfedges were not split (the ones not originally on edge b-c) and thus have different next() halfedges and faces after the split, 
              so we set those halfedges to their new next() halfedges and their new faces.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

          <h4>Implementation Summary</h4>

          <p>
              We first went through all the vertices to assign them as not new and calculated what their modified position should be using the given equations and stored it in newPosition.
              We then went through all the edges in the mesh, assigned them as not new,
              and calculated what their midpoint should be with the given equation in the spec and stored it in newPosition.
              After determining all the vertex positions, we iterated through the edges again to create the midpoint vertex and split the edges at that point.
              The newly created edges which were part of the original edge (i.e. c-m was part of edge b-c) were set to not new and their newPosition coordinate values set to the max float value,
              while the rest of the edges were set to new. The setting of the coordinate values prevents an infinite loop from occurring,
              since new “original edges” were being created. We then iterated through the edges again,
              flipping an edge if isNew was true and only one vertex was new.
              Finally, we reassigned the original vertex positions to their new, modified positions by setting position to newPosition.
          </p>

          <p>
              An interesting debugging trick we used was looking at the degree of a vertex after every upsample,
              which allowed us to see if the u- and n-value in the vertex-updating equation was being properly calculated.
          </p>

          <h4>Preprocessing</h4>

          <p>
              After loop subdivision, the sharp corners get smoother and the edges become smaller. 
              To reduce this smoothing effect, we can pre-split edges and our meshes with the pre-split edges
              will become rougher in texture when we perform loop subdivision.
              This happens because we are making more triangles,
              thus better preserving the original shape of the mesh before upsampling.
              For example, the cow maintains its pointy horns after one upsample because of how many faces are in the mesh,
              while the cube immediately loses its corners since each side only has 2 faces.
          </p>

          <p>
              Each cube side originally had 2 faces, thus only 2 vertices per face had degree 6 while the other 2 had degree 3,
              making the n- and u- values of the vertex updating equation different,
              so they become more asymmetrical as the cube was upsampled.
          </p>

          <p>
              In order for the cub to subdivide symmetrically, 
              we need to split our diagonal edges on all sides of the cube (making an “X” on all sides of our cube, as we can see in the pictures below). 
              This helps with alleviating the effects of a slightly asymmetric cube because each cube face has vertices with the same degree and triangles that are centered around the center of each cube face 
              (compared to the original cube.dae which had one edge leaning towards the side the asymmetry would eventually lean towards). 
              As a result, our loop subdivision will cause the cube to stay symmetric.
